<p id="Story">
The world is at peace in the present. Everyone lives in balance and harmony. This world was called Verleden.
But this wasn't like this in the past. Thousands of years in the past there were higher beings such as god and angels and demons.
Their light blessed the people of the world with prosperity and richness. 
As light was casted, there will always be shadows that form. The darkness was filled with hate and envy of the light. Demons wreak havoc across the world and send the world in chaos. 
These two fractions battled and clashed each other to conquer. This continued endlessly.
Until one war that ended everythingâ€¦
Now in the present, peace and harmony roamed the lands. Higher beings and demons were long forgotten and was considered as a fairy tale for children.
